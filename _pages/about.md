Hello! I am Xiwen Jiang, go by Josie. I am a fifth-year PhD candidate currently pursuing my degree in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). My academic journey has fueled my passion for data science and research, motivating me to seek opportunities as a Data Scientist or Research Data Scientist. My research focus revolves around trend filtering, time series data denoising, and machine learning, with a keen interest in applying these methodologies to advance clinical research and unravel insights from social networks. Beyond my academic pursuits, I find fulfillment in imparting statistical knowledge to students, relishing moments at the tennis court, and diving into the snow boarding in mountains.
